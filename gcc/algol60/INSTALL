Build Instructions
Required source packages

    * The core package of a recent 4.0.x release.
    * The GCC Algol 60 package from the main page.

Required software

    * The usual GCC requirements
      (http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html)
    * An existing C compiler (even if you use make bootstrap).  gcc
      3.x and newer will probably work.

Directories

    * <srcdir> -- Location of the GCC sources
    * <builddir> -- Build directory for GCC
    * <prefix> -- Install directory for GCC

Building the Compiler and Runtime Library

   1. Unpack the GCC archive.  This creates <srcdir>.
   2. Change the the <srcdir>/gcc directory.
   3. Unpack the gcc-algol60 archive.  This will create a subdirectory
      named "algol60".
   4. Build GCC using the normal install instructions.  The only difference is
      that "algol60" is added to the --enable-languages option.
      Remember to always use "gmake" if GNU Make is not the system's default.
   6. Install with "make install". 


Building a Cross Compiler

GCC Algol 60 was not tested as cross compiler yet.

Runtime Library Notes

No runtime library as of yet.
